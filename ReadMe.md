## Getting and Cleaning Data Project

This repository contains the solution to Getting and Cleaning data Course Project.

### Overview
This project serves to demonstrate the collection and cleaning of a tidy data set that can be used for subsequent
analysis. A full description of the data used in this project can be found at [The UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

[The source data for this project can be found here.](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

### How to Use
Download the source file and extract it into R working directory.
After this by running the code you will have the clean data set in the same folder as the previous data sets

### Project Tasks
This project consists of five different tasks listed below:

1-Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2-Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3-Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4-Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5-From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
